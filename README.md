**INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TASK**
Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism   
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism    


##  PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository contains code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset using Python. The goal of this analysis is to identify hot zones of terrorism based on the provided dataset. As a security/defense analyst, this EDA can help us gain insights into patterns, trends, and geographical concentrations of terrorist activities.

**Key Steps in the Analysis**
## Data Loading:  
Load the terrorism dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.  

## Data Preprocessing:   
Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and applying necessary transformations.  

## Exploratory Analysis:  
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of various attributes, such as attack types, weapons used, target types, and more.  

## Geographical Analysis:  
Utilize geospatial visualizations (maps) to identify regions with high frequency of terrorist incidents.  

## Temporal Analysis:  
Explore the temporal trends in terrorism incidents over the years.
