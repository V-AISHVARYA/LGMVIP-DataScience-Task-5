# LGMVIP-DataScience-Task-5

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This repository contains code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset using Python. The goal of this analysis is to identify hot zones of terrorism based on the provided dataset. As a security/defense analyst, this EDA can help us gain insights into patterns, trends, and geographical concentrations of terrorist activities.
